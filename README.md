# Action links

The Action Links module allows site admins to create links which perform an
action when clicked.

For example, an action link could toggle a node's published status, or change
a field value on an entity, or add a product to the user's shopping cart. Custom
actions can be defined in code with plugins, and customized in the UI.

Action links can be configured to use a JavaScript link which doesn't cause a
page reload, or can reload the page.

## Requirements

This module requires no modules outside of Drupal core.

publish it.
